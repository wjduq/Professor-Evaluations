# ProfessorEval

It is very important for schools to be able to receive accurate and fair evaluations of professors. If their are factors outside of a professors teaching skills that are affecting a professors score, then it is important to acknowledge them to avoid the termination of a professor who got a negative evaluation because of something they cannot control, such as ethnicity or gender. A study conducted at the University of Austin pooled evaluations from 463 professors at their campus, and asked six students to rate the professors on their physical appearance. The main question that is being asked is: What non-teaching characteristics affect a professors evaluation score. I will create a model that predicts, which of the 15 variables, are important to estimate the factors and their significance on a professors score.
